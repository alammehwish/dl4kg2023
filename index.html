                <p style="text-align:justify">Over the past years there has been a rapid growth in the use and the
                    importance
                    of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) along with their application to many important tasks. KGs are large
                    networks of
                    real-world entities described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to each
                    other. On the
                    other hand, Deep Learning methods have also become an important area of research, achieving some
                    important
                    breakthrough in various research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image
                    Recognition.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical
                    that the
                    communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP join their forces in order to
                    develop more
                    effective algorithms and applications.

                <h4>Towards cognitive-based knowledge engineering</h4>
                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                In recent years, a number of methodologies and tools have emerged in literature for building large knowledge graphs.
                Most of the focus on knowledge engineering (KE) techniques, i.e. the collection of activities for eliciting, capturing,
                conceptualising and formalising knowledge. However, KE tasks are extremely time-consuming and require a significant
                cognitive effort by knowledge engineers. More recently large-language models have shown promising results in many tasks
                related to knowledge engineering, such as knowledge extraction, ontology matching, schema induction, etc. An example is
                ChatGPT that can be used smoothly for generating knowledge graphs even starting from scenarios or competency questions.
                Following this research trend, neurosymbolic AI has been used for integrates neural and symbolic AI architectures to
                address the weaknesses of each in the context of KE, providing a robust AI capable of reasoning, learning, and
                generating knowledge graphs. But still a number of open issues remain open. One of them is about preserving the
                cognitive-soundness of traditional KE methodologies that were entirely human-centred. Prompting LLM with human
                metacognitive processes is a novel research direction that aims at instilling critical elements of human "thinking about
                thinking" into LLMs. The hypothesis is that metacognitive prompting can enhance the quality and cognitive-soundness of
                knowledge graphs resulting from KE processes.
                <h5>Bio</h5>
                Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese is a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies of the National
                Research Council. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2014 from the University of Bologna, with a focus on
                software methodologies and architectures for extracting Knowledge Patterns from the Web. His research interests include
                knowledge engineering, ontology design, linked data, the Semantic Web, knowledge extraction from heterogeneous formats,
                natural language understanding, and social and assistive robotics. He has participated as a researcher in the
                "Interactive Knowledge Stack2" (IKS) project (EU FP7) and the MARIO project (EU H2020). Currently, he is the scientific
                coordinator for ISTC-CNR in the Water Health Open Knowledge (WHOW) project (2019-EU-IA-0089 EU CEF Telecom - Public Open
                Data), aimed at designing and implementing a framework to facilitate the creation of a vast ecosystem of data related to
                water consumption and quality, health parameters, and disease prevalence for advanced analysis and the development of
                innovative services. He is the lead researcher for ISTC-CNR in the Hybrid Human Artificial Collective Intelligence in
                Open-Ended Domains (HACID) project (101070588 HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-01-10), focused on developing a new
                hybrid collective intelligence for decision support for professionals dealing with complex and open problems, promoting
                engagement, equity, and trust. He also leads research units and is a member of the executive board of the Fostering Open
                Science in Social Science Research (FOSSR) project (MUR PNRR IR IR0000008), which aims to become an Italian Open Science
                Cloud, similar to the European Open Science Cloud project, integrating innovative services developed by the project for
                data collection, management, and economic and social change data analysis, following the principle of equity. He is a
                program committee member for semantic web and ontology engineering conferences and workshops. Additionally, he serves as
                a reviewer for scientific journals such as the Semantic Web Journal and the Journal of Web Semantics. He is a co-founder
                of BUP Srl, an innovative startup dedicated to designing and implementing solutions for creating and managing knowledge
                graphs.

                <h4>CIMPLE: Hybridizing Knowledge Graph and LLM for Explaining
                    Factors Contributing to Misinformation</h4>
                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                In this talk, we will present some of the results of the CIMPLE project
                that makes use of generative AI to counter information manipulation. We
                present the CIMPLE Knowledge Graph that collects factchecks as well as
                claims and social media posts that convey some misinformation. We
                introduce the notion of factors that include political leaning, emotion,
                sentiment, the usage of propaganda and persuasion techniques or the
                support of conspiracy theories. We show to what extent LLM can be used
                to label misinformation and we present preliminary experiments that
                leverage knowledge graph embeddings to either identify misinformation
                spreaders, or to provide a finer-grained characterization of the phenomenon.
                <h5>Bio</h5>
                Raphaël Troncy is an Associate Professor at the Data Science Department
                of EURECOM, France since 2009, leading the Data-2-Knowledge team. His
                main research interest concerns the use of semantic web technologies for
                data integration, information extraction from text, tables and
                multimedia documents, and recommender systems. He has applied his
                research in diverse sectors such as Creative Industries, Cultural
                Heritage, Tourism, Automotive, ICT and Energy where the goal has been to
                produce specialized Knowledge Graphs and AI-based application for
                discovering and interacting with the data. He was General Chair of The
                Web Conference 2022 and he has published more than 250 papers.
